## Skills

#### Efficient and economical
To enable me to work effectively I carefully balance my need to make all of my work as perfect as possible with my concious effort to be as efficient as possible. During my career I have learned to strike a good balance between the two. My last role has taught me a lot about working to deadlines, working methodically to solve problems and communication which I have used to help me to become a better software developer.

#### Communication and teamwork
Teamwork and communication was an essential part of my previous role. Making sure everyone was aware of what they needed to do whilst communicating with each other to complete tasks cohesively. This enabled me to see the benefits of teamwork and communication which I use every day as a software developer to problem solve, pair programme and coach.

#### Analytical thinking and problem solving
Throughout my career the main part of my job has been to solve problems on a daily basis. This has allowed me to refine my analytical skills by first understanding the problems, prioritizing them and then dividing them into smaller solvable pieces. Along with teamwork and communication this approach has yielded positive results during my career.

## Hobbies

- I enjoy playing basketball and when I go on holiday, some basketball has to be involved! It is a real passion of mine and I love the team work and competitiveness, even when we lose it motivates me to learn and improve so we win next time.

- I enjoy travelling and have recently been to Greece, France, Spain, Bratislava and Luxembourg. I usually learn some of the language of the country I travel to, but then end up forgetting it due to lack of use. So I have decided to keep learning Romanian until I am fluent and hopefully not forget it.

- I like to keep active, so during lockdown I rediscovered my love of mountain biking. The first time I got back on a bike after many years all the good memories I had of riding through beautiful bike trails with friends came flooding back.
